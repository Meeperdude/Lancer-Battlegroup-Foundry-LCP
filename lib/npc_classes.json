      "flavor": "ACE SQUADRONS are specialized WINGS that players can take to represent particularly renowned and skilled pilots operating under their command. These can take the form of a diverse range of strike craft, including advanced fighters and bombers, and they can also serve to represent Lancer characters within the context of Battlegroup, allowing players to incorporate their mech pilots directly into the action as they lead a squadron of mounted chassis into battle. They are purchased with points and equipped to ships normally like other WINGS.",
