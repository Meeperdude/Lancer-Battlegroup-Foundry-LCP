The hull of the Farragut is robust and equipped with both launch bays and the sorts of armaments typically carried by frigates, allowing it a greater degree of independence, but its most unique feature is its modular housing bays. Engineered directly into its structure, these bays make it possible to quickly and effortlessly refit the Farragut for a variety of tactical and strategic purposes. It can be modified for everything from advanced systems implementation to increased offensive capability, additional flight decks, and enhanced subline capacity. More conservative naval commanders occasionally find the Farragut difficult to incorporate within standard deployment doctrines, and as a result it sees less widespread use outside of Purview forces.</div>",

The Louis XIV is the most advanced product of this research to date, and while it fails to completely address this problem, it is nonetheless viewed as a tangible sign of progress, wih optimistic futurists touting it as the shape of things to come. To further broaden its portfolio among Armory commanders, the ship’s shield arrays can also be tuned for remote projection, enabling it to extend its protection to other nearby vessels as well.</div>",

A potential paradigm-shifting development in naval warfare, the Union Intelligence Bureau and Union Naval Intelligence have both confirmed that the ship’s distinct emission signatures are consistent with those observed in the Armory’s Sunzi chassis, itself believed to have been developed with stolen Volador technology. This is the first known attempt by Armory engineers to incorporate this technology into a capital ship and the results are striking, granting commanders a battleship-class vessel capable of hit-and-run maneuvers unanticipated by a ship of its tonnage. With the escalation of conflicts in the Dawnline Shore, it appears that the Armory is using the opportunity to gather live combat data, leaving other forces operating in-theater scrambling to assemble a response. Commanders assigned to a Michel Ney operate under strict orders from the highest level of the Purview Directorate to never allow their vessel to fall into enemy hands, no matter the cost.</div>",

And ever since those ancient days, admirals and strategists have argued over the usefulness of the design with no end in sight. It is, however, generally agreed that IPS-N manufactures the most successful ships of this type, and the Greenland-class battlecarrier is the foremost example in its class, projecting fighter-tier superiority backed by superheavy ordnance. Most comfortable in close to medium ranges where its armaments can support its fighters and vice versa, the Greenland demands a careful balancing of priorities so as not to find itself outmaneuvered and exposed. Despite the contentious reputation of its ilk, the Greenland also enjoys the devoted and loyal favor of numerous commanders who view its idiosyncrasies as unique strengths.</div>",
